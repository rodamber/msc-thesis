Program synthesis is the problem of automatically generating concrete program
implementations from high-level specifications that define user intent.
OutSystems is a low-code platform for rapid application development,
and easy integration with existing systems, featuring both visual and
textual programming (expressions).
In this work, we focus on the textual programming side.
We tackle the problem of synthesizing OutSystems expressions in a setting where
the specifications are given in the form of input-output examples, focusing on
expressions that manipulate the Integer and Text datatypes.
We surveyed the state of the art in program synthesis, and implemented two
component-based \Glsfmtshort{pbe} synthesizers based on an \Glsfmtshort{ogis}
architecture.
Both synthesizers employ a mixture of constraint solving with basic enumerative
search, differing on the amount of work they put on the constraint solving
phase.
We benchmarked both synthesizers and compared them to
SyPet~\cite{Feng:2017:CSC} on a set of real world problems provided by
OutSystems, showing good results for programs of up to size 4.
