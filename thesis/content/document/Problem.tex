Extending Jha's et al. OG synthesis to work with several types.

Right now we are synthesizing straight-line programs (no loops or conditionals).

The output of the program is the output of the last component.

A solution (model) to this set of constraints can be decoded into a program.

The solver is therefore trying to find a program that satisfies the examples.

We are encoding in a formula the independent runs of the program over the
provided examples. One run per example. i^e, o^e, etc...

The properties we want to encode are:

- acyclicity
- ...

% Program paradigm
% Formula
% Example of the encoding of a concrete program and set of examples
% Solution for that example in terms of the assignment (model) of the formula

% Analysis of the size of the problem in function of the number of constants,
% components, arity of the components, number of examples, number of inputs,
% etc.
