\section{Search Techniques}
\label{sec:search-techniques}

The second part of solving a program synthesis problem is deciding which search
technique to apply in order to find the intended program.
First, we want to ensure that the program satisfies the semantic and syntactic
specifications.
Second, we want to leverage the specifications and the knowledge we have from
the problem domain in order to guide the search.
Common search techniques are
% deductive search (Section~\ref{sec:deductive-synthesis}),
enumerative search~\cite{Alur:2017:SEP}
(Section~\ref{sec:enumerative-search}),
stochastic search~\cite{Schkufza:2013:SS,Singh:ranking:2015}
(Section~\ref{sec:stochastic-search}), and
constraint solving~\cite{Feng:2018:PSU,Feng:2017:CST,Feng:2017:CSC}
(Section~\ref{sec:constraint-solving}).
Modern synthesizers usually apply a combination of those, and so we can also
talk about frameworks for structuring their construction, such as
\gls{cegis}~\cite{Solar-Lezama:2008},
\gls{cegis}($\mathcal{T}$)~\cite{Abate:2018:CMT}, and
\gls{ogis}~\cite{Jha:2017:TFS}
(Section~\ref{sec:ogis}).
