\subsection{Programs}
\label{sec:programs}

A program can also be used as a specification and the job of the synthesizer is
then to find another program with the same semantics. We might also be
interested in programs that behave the same way as the original one, but, for
example, are more efficient (according to some metric).

Typically, the original programs are not made to be efficient, but to be easy to
read or to prove correct. They may also appear naturally as specifications in
certain use cases, such as
superoptimization~\cite{Phothilimthana:2016:SUS},
deobfuscation~\cite{Jha:oracle:2010} and
synthesis of program inverses~\cite{Srivastava:2011:PIS}.
