\chapter{Synthesis}
\label{chap:synthesis}

This chapter describes the problem (Section~\ref{sec:problem-description}) and
the approaches that were studied in order to solve it. The first one
(Section~\ref{sec:setwise-encoding}), is an adaptation of a component-based
constraint solving approach previously applied to the synthesis of bitvector
programs~\cite{Gulwani:2011:SLP, Jha:oracle:2010}.
