\chapter{Synthesis}
\label{chap:synthesis}

This chapter describes the problem (Section~\ref{sec:problem-description}) and
the approaches that were studied in order to solve it.
Both approaches
(Sections~\ref{sec:setwise-encoding}~and~\ref{sec:whole-encoding}) are
adaptations of a component-based constraint solving approach previously applied
to the synthesis of bitvector programs~\cite{Gulwani:2011:SLP, Jha:oracle:2010}.
Section~\ref{sec:smt-interlude} explains how the components that we use are
encoded in \gls{smt}.
