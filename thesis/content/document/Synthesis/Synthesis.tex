\chapter{Synthesis}
\label{chap:synthesis}

This chapter describes the problem statement, its definition, and the approaches
that were studied in order to solve it. The first one, described in
section~\ref{sec:setwise-encoding}, is based on a component-based constraint
solving approach first applied to the synthesis of bitvector
programs~\cite{Gulwani:2011:SLP, Jha:oracle:2010}.
