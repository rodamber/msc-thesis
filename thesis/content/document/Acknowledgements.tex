First of all I would like to thank my supervisors, Professor Inês Lynce and
Miguel Ventura, and to Ruben Martins, my advisor at Carnegie Mellon, for their
experienced advice and tireless guidance, without which I certainly would not
have finished my master's thesis in time.

I would like to thank Ruben Martins for the warm welcome at Carnegie Mellon, and
whose incredible patience gave me the opportunity to learn, not only about the
field of program synthesis, but also how the academic world turns.

I would like to thank Professor Vasco Manquinho and Professor Justine Sherry for
providing access to computer hardware that was vital for this work, and for the
always very quick support for any help I needed.

Also, I would like to thank Pedro Orvalho and Miguel Neves for the always
insightful comments that certainly helped improve the quality of the thesis.

I would like to thank my beloved parents, who laid the foundations for me to
become the person I am today for their uncoditional love and support.
Not a single day has passed without me thinking about them.

I would like to thank OutSystems for the financial support and access to their
installations and great work environment.
Finally, I would like to thank \textit{Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia},
through which this work was partially supported by national funds with reference
UID/CEC/50021/2019.
