\subsection{Programs}
\label{sec:programs}

A program can also be used as a specification. It can act as a reference and the
job of synthesizer is then to find a program with the same semantics, but better
according to some predefined metric. Typically, reference programs are not made
to be efficient, but to be easy to read or to prove correct. % FIXME: ref?
Programs appear naturally as specifications in certain use cases, such as
superoptimization, deobfuscation and reverse engineering. % FIXME: refs?
