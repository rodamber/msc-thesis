\section{\textit{How to ask it}: Specifications and Syntactic Bias}
\label{sec:specifications}

% General problems with this section:
% - Fails to explore the shortcomings of each approach.
% - Lacks examples to explain the exposed ideas.
% - Few references. I'm sure the coverage of the state of the art could be

% - Still incomplete.

The first part of solving a program synthesis problem is figuring out which
method will use to express our intent to the sinthesizer.
That intent may be specified in many different ways, including:
  logical specifications \cite{Itzhaky:SIS:2010};
  type signatures \cite{Osera:2015:TPS, Frankle:2016:EST, Polikarpova:2016:PSP};
  components \cite{Feng:2017:CST, Feng:2017:CSC, Feng:2018:PSU, Shi:2019:FCS};
  syntax-guided methods \cite{Alur:sygus:2013} such as
  sketches \cite{Solar-Lezama:2008};
  or incomplete specifications such as
  input-output examples \cite{Frankle:2016:EST, Gulwani:2012:SDM, Leung:2015:IPS},
  demonstrations \cite{Lau2003}
  or program traces \cite{Lau:traces:2003}.
The kind of specification used typically depends on the particular problem at
hand, especially when taking into account the multitude of different user
backgrounds, and it might also dictate the type of techniques used to solve the
problem.
