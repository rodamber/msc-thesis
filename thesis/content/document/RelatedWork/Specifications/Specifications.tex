The first part of solving a program synthesis problem is figuring out in which
way the users will express their intent.
That intent may be specified in many different ways, including:
  logical \cite{Itzhaky:SIS:2010}
  or type-based specifications \cite{Osera:2015:TPS, Frankle:2016:EST,
    Polikarpova:2016:PSP};
  syntax-guided methods \cite{Alur:sygus:2013} such as
  sketches \cite{Solar-Lezama:2008};
  or incomplete specifications such as
  input-output examples \cite{Frankle:2016:EST, Gulwani:2012:SDM, Leung:2015:IPS},
  demonstrations \cite{Lau2003}
  or program traces \cite{Lau:traces:2003}.
The kind of specification used typically depends on the particular problem at
hand, especially when taking into account the multitude of different user
backgrounds, and it might also dictate the type of techniques used to solve the
problem.
