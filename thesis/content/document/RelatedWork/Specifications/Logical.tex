\subsection{Logical Specifications}
\label{sec:logical}

Logical specifications are the canonical way of introducing specifications. In
the sorting example from the introduction (\ref{sec:sorting-example}) we already
saw an example of this where the specifications were given as logical
pre/post-conditions over the inputs/outputs of the program. In that case, the
specifications were written as predicates in the host programming language.
Logical specifications \todo{may also be given as loop invariants or general
assertions in the code}{refs. leon?}, in order to give more hints to the
synthesizer.
