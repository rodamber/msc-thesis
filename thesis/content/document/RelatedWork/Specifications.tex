\section{Specifications}
\label{sec:specifications}

\begin{itemize}
\item syntactic bias, sketches, metasketches (sketch generation), templates, skeleton,
\item   grammar, dsls, holes, SyGuS
\item programming by example, input-output examples/constraints, inductive programming
\item from execution traces
\item another program
\item logical relation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sketching}

Introduced in \cite{Solar-Lezama:2008}.

Some specs are difficult to master (tricky or involved, the formalism may be
hard, etc) and/or ``far removed from traditional programming models'' (Solar-Lezama).

Insight is given by incomplete programs which express the high-level structure
of the procedures while leaving missing parts, called holes, for the synthesizer
to fill.
