This chapter discusses the fundamentals of the field of program synthesis and a
broad overview of the state of the art, with a focus on constraint solving and
\gls{pbe}.
Section~\ref{sec:specifications} discusses several ways to describe intent to
the synthesizer; % TODO such as...
Section~\ref{sec:search-techniques} discusses techniques to search the program
space for the intended program; % TODO again, such as...
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:pbe} refers to related work done specifically in the
area of \gls{pbe}.

\citeauthor{Gulwani2017} presented a broader overview of the field as of
2017~\cite{Gulwani2017}.
