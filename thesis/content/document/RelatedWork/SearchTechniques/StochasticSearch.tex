\subsection{Stochastic Search}
\label{sec:stochastic-search}

Stochastic search is an approach to program synthesis where the synthesizer uses
probabilistic reasoning to learn a program conditioned on the specification. Two
typical approaches to applying stochastic search in synthesizers are as follows.
One is to learn a \textit{guiding function} that works on top of an enumerative
search algorithm to help it predict which program from the search space is most
likely to meet the desired specification. Another one is to learn a probability
distribution over the search space in order to sample programs that are more
promising. Below, we can find high-level descriptions of specific instances of
these kinds of synthesis.

\subsubsection{Sampling the Search Space}

In this section we describe the stochastic synthesizer used by
\citeauthor{Alur:sygus:2013} in their syntax-guided synthesis
paper~\cite{Alur:sygus:2013}. Their synthesizer learns from examples and is
adapted from work on superoptimization of loop-free binary
programs~\cite{Schkufza:2013:SS}. They define a score function, $Score$, that
measures the extent which a given program is consistent with the specification.
Then they perform a probabilistic walk over the search space while maximizing
this score function. The algorithm works by first picking a program $p$ of fixed
size $n$ uniformly at random. They then pick a node from its parse tree
uniformly at random and consider the subprogram rooted at that node. They then
substitute it with another subprogram of same size and type, chosen uniformly at
random, obtaining a new program $p'$. The probability of discarding $p$ for $p'$
is given by the formula $min(1, Score(p')/Score(p))$. It remains to say how to
pick the value of $n$. Typically we do not know the size of the desired program
from the start. In order to tackle this problem, they start by fixing its value
at $n = 1$ and at each iteration change its value to $min(1, n\pm{}1)$ with with
some small probability (default is 0.01).
