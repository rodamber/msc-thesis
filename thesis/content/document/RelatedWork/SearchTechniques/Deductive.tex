\subsection{Deductive Synthesis}
\label{sec:deductive-synthesis}

The fundamental idea in deductive synthesis is to extract a program
automatically from the constructive proof of a theorem induced by the
specification. Typically, the kinds of specifications associated with this
method of synthesis are logical relations between inputs and the outputs of the
program. 

These systems tend to require a complete formal specification, and the level
of expertise needed to use them turn them easily unapproachable by the user
which is not mathematically inclined.
