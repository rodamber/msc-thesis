\citeauthor{Alur:sygus:2013}~\cite{Alur:sygus:2013} presented an overview of the
most common search techniques used in the field of program synthesis.

% TODO: It might be the case that it makes more sense to expose SyGuS here
% instead of in the previous section. It's more of a learning bias than a kind
% of specification. The overview seems to do this.
% ON THE OTHER HAND: It might also make sense to put it in the previous section
% because it answers the question of how to ask it. Maybe the title should be
% changed to Specifications and Syntactic Bias?
% TODO: Also, I think it's important to refer to SyGuS explicitly.

% ``In deductive synthesis (e.g., [42]), a program is synthesized by constructively
% proving a theorem, employing logical inference and constraint solving.''

% of partial information about the solution.''
