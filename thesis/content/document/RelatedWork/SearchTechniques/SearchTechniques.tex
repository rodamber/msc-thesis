\citeauthor{Alur:sygus:2013}~\cite{Alur:sygus:2013} presented an overview of the
most common search techniques used in the field of program synthesis.

% TODO: It might be the case that it makes more sense to expose SyGuS here
% instead of in the previous section. It's more of a learning bias than a kind
% of specification. The overview seems to do this.
% ON THE OTHER HAND: It might also make sense to put it in the previous section
% because it answers the question of how to ask it. Maybe the title should be
% changed to Specifications and Syntactic Bias?

% - deductive search
% - transformation-based search
% - enumerative search (top-down, bottom-up, bidirectional, offline exhaustive enumeration and composition)
% - constraint-based search (component based, sketch generation/completion, solver-aided programming, ILP, )
% - statistical search (machine learning, genetic programming, MCMC, sampling, probabilistic inference)
% - Neural-guided search
% - Graph neural networks
% - PBE VSAs, deduction-based, inverse semantics, type-based, ambiguity, intent
% - meta-synthesis, rosette, prose, sketch, solver-aided programming, domain separation
% - ranking: MCMC, VSA, ML, Metasketches
% - conflict-driven learning
% - Counterexample Guided Inductive Synthesis Modulo Theories*

% proving a theorem, employing logical inference and constraint solving.''
