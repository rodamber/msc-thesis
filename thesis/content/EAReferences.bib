New and popular variations on the synthesis problem accept specifications in formats that are easier for the human synthesis user to provide: input-output example pairs, type information, and partial logical specifications. These are all partial specification formats, encoding only a fraction of the expected behavior of the program, leaving many matching programs. This transition into partial specification also changes the mode of work for the user, who now provides additional specifications as long as they are unhappy with the result. This turns synthesis into an iterative, interactive process.},

  abstract  = {Development of computer aided verification tools has greatly benefited from SMT technologies; instead of writing an ad-hoc reasoning engine, designers translate their problem into SMT queries which solvers can efficiently solve. Translating a problem into effective SMT queries, however, is itself a tedious, error-prone, and non-trivial task. This paper introduces Smten, a tool for automatically translating high-level symbolic computations into SMT queries. We demonstrate the use of Smten in the development of an SMT-based string constraint solver.},
