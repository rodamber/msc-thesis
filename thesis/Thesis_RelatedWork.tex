\todo{Should ``program synthesis'' be capitalized?}
This chapter discusses the state of the art of the field of program synthesis.
Section~\ref{sec:challenges} presents the inherent challenges of the problem,
such as resolving ambiguity or the size of the search space;
\todo{Very ugly...}section~\ref{sec:specifications} presents the various forms
that specifications can take;
section~\ref{sec:applications} presents applications of the problem;
section~\ref{sec:search-techniques} presents techniques to prune the search
space;
section~\ref{sec:inductive-programming} presents program synthesis with
approximate specifications;
section~\ref{sec:pbe} refers to work done specifically in the area of
\ac{PBE}.

% oracles (validation, correction, programs), CEGIS, OGIS, (universal) distinguishing inputs
% constraint-based search (component based, sketch generation/completion, solver-aided programming, ILP, )
% statistical search (machine learning, genetic programming, MCMC, sampling, probabilistic inference)
% Neural-guided search
% Graph neural networks
% PBE VSAs, deduction-based, inverse semantics, type-based, ambiguity, intent
% Active learning, interaction, distinguishing inputs

% meta-synthesis, rosette, prose, sketch, solver-aided programming, domain separation

% ranking approaches: MCMC, VSA, ML, Metasketches

\section{Inductive Programming}

This refers to any kind of program synthesis problem where the constraints are
under-specified. \todo{TODO}
