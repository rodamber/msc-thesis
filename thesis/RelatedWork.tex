\todo{Search space?}\section{Search Techniques}
\label{sec:search-techniques}

\todo{Ref. is Ras Bodik ICFP15 talk} Derivation (deductive search?) applies
semantics-preserving rewrite rules... correctness by construction.
Search (enumerative search?) sidesteps this, but the program space can be too large.
One way to tackle this issue is to syntactically restrict the space of valid
programs. We can do this by restricting the programs to those expressible in a
small DSL:
\marginpar{Check more recent research} Gulwani and Sumit \cite{Gulwani:2011}
used FlashFill to automate string processing in the context of spreadsheet
applications using input-output examples;
Cheung et al. \cite{Cheung:2013} used a subset of SQL to synthesize optimized
database-backed applications;
the FlashExtract DSL \cite{Le:2014} includes programs that take semi-structured
text files and a data structure definition as input, and return an instance of
that data structure;\todo{How comprehensive should I be?}.

Another approach is to let the user provide a partial program, hinting the
structure of the intended implementation, while leaving holes for the
synthesizer to fill:

templates \cite{Srivastava:2012},
holes (like SIMD magic constants) \cite{Solar-Lezama:2008}


\begin{itemize}
\item deductive search
\item transformation-based search
\item enumerative search (top-down, bottom-up, bidirectional, offline exhaustive enumeration and composition)
\item oracles (validation, correction, programs), CEGIS, OGIS, (universal) distinguishing inputs
\item constraint-based search (component based, sketch generation/completion, solver-aided programming, ILP, )
\item statistical search (machine learning, genetic programming, MCMC, sampling, probabilistic inference)
\item Neural-guided search
\item Graph neural networks
\item PBE VSAs, deduction-based, inverse semantics, type-based, ambiguity, intent
\item Active learning, interaction, distinguishing inputs
\item meta-synthesis, rosette, prose, sketch, solver-aided programming, domain separation
\item ranking: MCMC, VSA, ML, Metasketches
\end{itemize}

\section{Inductive Programming}
\label{sec:inductive-programming}

This refers to any kind of program synthesis problem where the constraints are
under-specified.

\subsection{Programming by Examples}
\label{sec:pbe}

\begin{itemize}
\item PBE (inductive programming)
\item examples
\item inverse semantics
\item VSA
\end{itemize}
