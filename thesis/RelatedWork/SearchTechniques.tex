\pdfmargincomment{Ref. is Ras Bodik ICFP15 talk} Derivation (deductive search?)
applies semantics-preserving rewrite rules... correctness by construction.
Search (enumerative search?) sidesteps this, but the program space can be too
large. One way to tackle this issue is to syntactically restrict the space of
valid programs. We can do this by restricting the programs to those expressible
in a small DSL: \pdfmargincomment{Check out more recent research.} Gulwani and
Sumit \cite{Gulwani:2011} used FlashFill to automate string processing in the
context of spreadsheet applications using input-output examples; Cheung et al.
\cite{Cheung:2013} used a subset of SQL to synthesize optimized database-backed
applications; the FlashExtract DSL \cite{Le:2014} includes programs that take
semi-structured text files and a data structure definition as input, and return
an instance of that data structure;.

Another approach is to let the user provide a partial program, hinting the
structure of the intended implementation, while leaving holes for the
synthesizer to fill:

templates \cite{Srivastava:2012},
holes (like SIMD magic constants) \cite{Solar-Lezama:2008}

automatically generate test inputs and ensure that the generated program
satisfies its specification.''}{Copied from the his abstract.}

of partial information about the solution.''}{From Solar-Lezama thesis, p.25}

\item oracles (validation, correction, programs), CEGIS, OGIS, (universal) distinguishing inputs
\item constraint-based search (component based, sketch generation/completion, solver-aided programming, ILP, )
\item statistical search (machine learning, genetic programming, MCMC, sampling, probabilistic inference)
\item Neural-guided search
\item Graph neural networks
\item PBE VSAs, deduction-based, inverse semantics, type-based, ambiguity, intent
