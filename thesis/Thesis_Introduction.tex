\label{chapter:introduction}

In program synthesis we are interested in automatically finding programs that
satisfy some high-level specifications. Typically, these take the form of

$\exists P \ldotp \phi(P) $

% Some kinds of specifications are:
% -

% Applications/goals are:
% -

% Automating this work is good because:
% - code is correct by construction
% -
